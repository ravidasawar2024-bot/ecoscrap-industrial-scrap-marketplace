# ecoscrap-industrial-scrap-marketplace
EcoScrap is a frontend-only web application that connects buyers and sellers of industrial scrap materials such as metal, plastic, e-waste, paper, glass, and more.

It allows users to browse listings, search and filter materials, add new scrap listings, and contact sellers — all in a simple and user-friendly interface.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript and works completely on the client side.
